Sandbox Environment
===================

IEX provides a `sandbox environment`_ for IEX Cloud. This environment can be
accessed by setting ``IEX_API_VERSION`` to ``iexcloud-sandbox``. This will set ``iexfinance`` up for use with the sandbox base URL.

.. note:: Test keys (beginning with ``Tsk`` and ``Tpk``) must be used with the sandbox environment. To obtain these keys, select the "Viewing test data" toggler on the left side of the IEX Cloud console.

The sandbox environment is recommended for testing purposes. Messages used in the sandbox environment will not count against a user's monthly message limit.
